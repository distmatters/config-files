# Linux Config Files

This repository contains configurations I found useful for my own use on Fedora
29 (although this is subject to change as newer versions are released) using a
custom set up involving Openbox, Nitrogen, Stalone Tray, pnmixer, Network
Manager, Conky, and some various tools from XFCE4 (polkit, power manager,
terminal, etc.).

## Custom Scripts

The repository also includes custom scripts written for various purposes 
related to the use of my particular laptop - a Dell XPS 9370. These include
kill_touchscreen.sh which turns off the laptops touchscreen, and setup.sh which
creates symlinks and installs plugin managers after a fresh install. 

## In Conclusion

If any of the scripts or configs are useful for your work or personal life feel
free to use modify them etc. I've set the license to BSD 3-clause but even that
is more restrictive than I think is necessary for this stuff. If you feel like
you owe me something buy me a La Croix (I prefer the 'pure' flavor) next time 
we meet.
